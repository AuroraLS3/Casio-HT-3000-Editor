# Casio-HT-3000-Editor
Attempt to create a patch editor for Casio HT-3000 via MIDI output

Project has been abadoned after tests with the device failed to get any response from the device.

The tester in the app can be used to send MIDI-out signals for testing purposes, but it is pretty limited in what it can do.
